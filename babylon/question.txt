The game Babylon is a two-player alternating-moves game - like tic-tac-toe, or chess, or go. It's played with twelve tiles: three each of four colors.

    The tiles start out in 12 stacks of height 1.
    A move consists of combining two stacks: putting one whole stack on top of another.
    You are allowed to combine two stacks if either the heights match, or the top tile colors match.
    You win if you are the last player to move. You lose if it's your turn and there are no moves.

Write a program to answer the question: who wins, with perfect play? (The first or the second player?)
