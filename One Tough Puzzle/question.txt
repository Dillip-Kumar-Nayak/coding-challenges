The puzzle is called "One Tough Puzzle" (available from Amazon and others) and consists of 9 puzzle pieces, each with four interlocks (two in and two out). 
The interlocks are shaped like each of the four suits in a conventional deck of cards, so a positive heart interlock can link with a negative heart interlock, 
and so on. image.png is a picture of what the puzzle pieces more or less look like.

To solve the puzzle, one must arrange the pieces such that they form a three by three square when interlocked. The outer edges don't necessarily have to be neat
or uniform in any way, but the box does specify that there will be six interlocks protruding from the edge of the finished puzzle. Because of this lack of an edge,
the puzzle offers basically no hints as to whether or not you're headed down the right path, making it especially frustrating and probably near impossible for someone
without tons of time on his or her hands.
