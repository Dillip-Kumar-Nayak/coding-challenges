Implement the C++ function std::string findNextInsertPosition(TreeNode* root) for a balanced binary tree (not necessarily a Binary Search Tree). In this tree, nodes are filled from left to right, and before moving to the next level, all positions in the previous level are filled. The function should return a string representing the next position for inserting a new node into the tree.
For example, given the tree:
                  1
              /       \
             2         3
            / \       /
           4  5      6
The expected output should be '3 (right)', indicating that the new node should be inserted as the right child of node 3.

Try to solve it in less than linear (O(n)) time.
